Why might this produce a measurement bias?\n\n\nStudents may not want to admit to vaping in front of their teachers and peers. This would lead to inaccurate count of the students who vape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 3.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nInternet polls are very common with local news organizations. Why might internet polls produce a sampling bias?\n\n\nInternet polls may produce a sampling bias because they only include individuals who have internet access and are willing to participate in online surveys. This may exclude certain demographics, leading to a non-representative sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 4.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nIdentify possible biases from each of the following situations\n\nA survey of college students’ music preferences asks “Do you like rock music or another genre?”\nSuppose the county commissioners want to know if the county residents support constructing a new high-rise on the beach. They send out a survey to only beach residents.\n\n\n\na. The question is leading because it suggests that rock music is the preferred choice. b. The sample is biased because it only includes beach residents, who may have different opinions than non-beach residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 5.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nSuppose you want to estimate the mean GPA of all students at your school. You set up a table in the library asking for volunteers to tell you their GPAs. Do you think you would get a representative sample? Why or why not?\n\n\nNo. Students who volunteer to report their GPA may be more likely to have higher GPAs, leading to a sampling bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 6.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nAn August 2022 article from Forbes magazine read:\n“Results are in from the Florida’s first mandated system-wide survey of”intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity” at its public universities, and one indisputable conclusion can be drawn from it: most students, staff, and faculty ignored it, yielding little in the way of trustworthy results. The survey was required when Florida’s Republican-controlled Legislature at the urging of Governor Ron DeSantis, enacted House Bill 233, creating section 1001.73(13), in Florida Statutes, entitled INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AND VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT…Of the 368,000 college students who received the voluntary survey, 8,835, a measly 2.4%, completed it, according to the report presented Friday to the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System of Florida.”\nThe survey included questions such as: “How should colleges or universities handle students who disrupt invited speakers and prevent them from speaking?”” followed by a list of punitive measures. What biases, if any, do you find from this survey?\n\n\nThe low response rate (2.4%) indicates a likely sampling bias, as those who chose to respond may have different views than the overall population of students, staff, and faculty. Additionally, the wording of the question about disruptive students may introduce measurement bias, as it frames the issue in a way that could influence respondents’ answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 7.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA phone survey asked whether Social Security should be continued or abandoned immediately. Only landlines (not cell phones) were called. Do you think this would introduce bias? Explain.\n\n\nYes. This would likely introduce sampling bias because individuals who only use cell phones (often younger demographics) are excluded from the survey, potentially skewing the results towards the opinions of older individuals who are more likely to have landlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 8.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA school district is interested in finding out what percentage of voters in the district would favor the passage of a school bond measure. The district sends out a survey to all school parents asking, “Do you favor the passing of a school bond measure to provide additional resources to improve educational opportunities for your students?” Identify any sources of possible bias in this survey.\n\n\nThe question is leading, as it suggests that passing the bond measure will improve educational opportunities, which may influence respondents to answer favorably. Additionally, only parents of students in the school district are surveyed, which may not represent the views of all voters in the district."

    "text": "Section 7.2: Measure the Quality of a Survey\n\nStatistical Inference\nOne of the most import application of statistics is statistical inference, which is the process of using data from a sample to make estimates or test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population. However, since we are using a sample to make inferences about a population, there is always some uncertainty involved. Fortunately, we can quantify this uncertainty by measuring the quality of our estimates. Two important aspects of the quality of an estimate are its accuracy and precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAccuracy vs. Precision\n\n\n\n\nAccurate: The measurement process captures the intended quantity; it correctly estimates the population parameter.\nPrecise: If the measurement process is repeated, the estimates are very consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 1.

Estimating the Population Proportion with Confidence Intervals\n\nUse the central limit theorem to construct a confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe now focus on inferential statistics. Often it is easy to calculate statistics from a sample, but it is difficult (and sometimes impossible) to calculate parameters from a population.\n\n\n\nCreating a Confidence Interval for Estimating the Population Proportion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 7.4.1.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nAccording to pewresearch.org, an October 2016 article indicated that 685 of 1,201 adults randomly surveyed favor the legalization of marijuana.\n\nWhat percent of the adults surveyed supported the requirement to legalize marijuana?\nIs the value in part (a) a sample statistic or a population parameter?\nDo you know the percentage of all American adults (\\(p\\)) that support legalization of marijuana?\nDo you think the percent of adults surveyed who support the requirement is exactly equal to the percent of all American adults who support legalization? That is, is our sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) exactly equal to the population proportion (\\(p\\))?\n\n\n\na. The percent of adults surveyed who supported legalization is \\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{685}{1201} \\approx 0.5704 \\text{ or } 57.04\\%.\n\\] b. The value in part (a) is a sample statistic. c. No, we do not know the percentage of all American adults (\\(p\\)) that support legalization of marijuana. d. No, we do not think that the sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) is exactly equal to the population proportion (\\(p\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the previous sections, we know the following facts:\n\nOur estimator, \\(\\hat{p}\\), is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion, \\(p\\). Therefore, the population parameter, \\(p\\), should be close to our sample statistic, \\(\\hat{p}\\).\nThe standard error is estimated as \\[\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{est}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.57(1-0.57)}{1201}} \\approx 0.0143.\n\\]\nSince the sample size is large, the probability distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is approximately normal and centered around the true population proportion.\nThere is about a 95% chance that \\(\\hat{p}\\) is within two standard errors of population proportion \\(p\\). Thus, \\[\n2 \\times \\text{SE} = 2 \\times 0.0143 = 0.0286.\n\\]\nTherefore, we are 95% confident that the value of the true population proportion is within 2.86 percentage points of 0.57.\nHence, we are 95% confident that the true population proportion (i.e., the proportion of all American adults who support legalization of marijuana) is between \\[\n0.57 - 0.0286 = 0.5414\n\\] and \\[\n0.57 + 0.0286 = 0.5986.\n\\] This is called a confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConfidence Interval\n\n\n\nConfidence intervals provide us with\n\nA range of possible values for a population parameter.\nA confidence level, which express our level of confidence that the interval contains the true population parameter.\nTells us that how often the estimation is successful.\nMeasure the success rate of the method, not of any one particular interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMargin of Error\n\n\n\nThe margin of error tells us how far from the population parameter our estimate can be. \\[\n  \\text{Margin of Error} = z^* \\times \\text{SE}_{\\text{est}},\n\\] where \\(z^*\\) indicates the number of standard errors to include in the margin of error.\nFrom the empirical rule, we know that\n\n\\(z^\\ast = 1\\) corresponds with an approximate confidence level of 68%;\n\\(z^\\ast = 2\\) corresponds with an approximate confidence level of 95%;\n\\(z^\\ast = 3\\) corresponds with an approximate confidence level of 99.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConfidence Level & Margin of Error\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the more precise \\(z^\\ast\\) values for some frequently used confidence levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Level\nMargin of Error is\n\\(z^\\ast\\)\n\n\n\n\n80%\n1.282 Standard Errors\n1.282\n\n\n90%\n1.645 Standard Errors\n1.645\n\n\n95%\n1.960 Standard Errors\n1.960\n\n\n99%\n2.576 Standard Errors\n2.576\n\n\n99.7%\n3 Standard Errors\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConfidence Interval for a Population Proportion.\n\n\n\nConfidence intervals are of the form: \\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm m,\n\\] where \\(m\\) is the margin of error. Since \\(m = z^\\ast \\cdot \\text{SE}\\), where \\(\\text{SE}\\) is the standard error, the confidence interval is \\[\n  \\hat{p} \\pm z^\\ast \\cdot \\text{SE} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (\\hat{p} - z^\\ast \\cdot \\text{SE}, \\; \\hat{p} + z^\\ast \\cdot \\text{SE}).\n\\]\nTo find SE, we substitute \\(\\hat{p}\\) for \\(p\\), since \\(p\\) is unknown, and estimate the standard error as \\[\n  \\text{SE}_{\\text{est}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningRemark.\n\n\n\nSince the confidence interval calculations are based on the central limit theorem for sample proportions, the conditions for the CLT must be satisfied to create a confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConditions for the Central Limit Theorem for Sample Proportions\n\n\n\n\nSampling is random and independent.\nLarge sample: The sample size, 𝑛, is large enough to expect at least 10 successes and 10 failures. That is, \\(np \\geqslant 10\\) and \\(n(1-p) \\geqslant 10\\).\nLarge population: If the sampling is done without replacement, the population must be at least 10 times larger than the sample size."

    "text": "Section 7.4 Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 1.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\n\nDuring a recent semester, 63 of the 159 MAT 223 students randomly surveyed indicated that they had a negative situation occurred to them based on a posting on social media. Let us estimate the percentage of all Flagler College students who had a negative situation occur to them based on a posting on social media.\n\n\nWhat percent of the students surveyed had a negative situation occur to them based on a posting on social media?\nWhat symbol do we use to represent the proportion (percentage) that we calculated in (a)? Is this value a sample statistic or a population parameter?\nCheck the conditions of the central limit theorem to create a confidence interval.\n\n\nIs the sample random and independent?\nIs the sample size sufficiently large?\nIs the population sufficiently large?\n\n\nCalculate the standard error.\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval. What is the value of \\(z^\\ast\\)?\n\n\nCalculate the margin of error.\nFind the lower bound of the confidence interval.\nFind the upper bound of the confidence interval.\n\n\nGraph and label the confidence interval.\nInterpret the confidence interval.\n\n\n\na. The percentage is \\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{63}{159} \\approx 0.396 \\text{ or } 39.6\\%.\n\\] b. The symbol we use to represent the proportion calculated in (a) is \\(\\hat{p}\\). This value is a sample statistic. c. Conditions: - Yes, the sample is random and independent. - Yes, the sample size is sufficiently large since \\(n\\hat{p} = 159 \\times 0.396 \\approx 63 \\geqslant 10\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{p}) = 159 \\times (1-0.396) \\approx 96 \\geqslant 10\\). - Yes, the population is sufficiently large since the population of Flagler College students is much larger than 10 times the sample size. d. The standard error is estimated as \\[\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{est}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.396(1-0.396)}{159}} \\approx 0.0387.\n\\] e. To construct a 95% confidence interval, we use \\(z^\\ast = 1.960\\). - The margin of error is \\[\n  m = z^\\ast \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{est}} = 1.960 \\times 0.0387 \\approx 0.0758.\n  \\] - The lower bound of the confidence interval is \\[\n  \\hat{p} - m = 0.396 - 0.0758 \\approx 0.3202.\n  \\] - The upper bound of the confidence interval is \\[\n  \\hat{p} + m = 0.396 + 0.0758  \\approx 0.4718.\n  \\] g. We are 95% confident that the true proportion of all Flagler College students who had a negative situation occur to them based on a posting on social media is between approximately 32.02% and 47.18%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 2.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nAccording to pewresearch.org, a 2014 survey found that 32.1% of adults aged 18–34 were living with their parents. Suppose that this was based on a random sample of 1,200 adults in this age group.\n\nCheck that the conditions for the CLT apply.\nUse the app to find the confidence interval using confidence levels of 80%, 90%, 95%, and 99% to estimate the population proportion of all Americans in this age group who live with their parents.\nWhat happened to the confidence interval as the level of confidence increases?\nIs it plausible to conclude that the true percentage of adults in this age group living with parents is 38%?\n\n\n\na. The sample is random and independent. Since \\(n\\hat{p} = 1200 \\times 0.321 = 385.2 \\geqslant 10\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{p}) = 1200 \\times (1-0.321) = 814.8 \\geqslant 10\\), the sample size is sufficiently large. The population is sufficiently large since the population of adults aged 18–34 is much larger than 10 times the sample size. b. c. As the level of confidence increases, the confidence interval becomes wider. d. We are 99% confident that the true percentage is between 28.6% and 35.6%. Because 38% is not in this interval, it is not plausible that the true percentage is 38%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantImportant\n\n\n\nAs the confidence level increase, the length of the confidence interval also increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 3.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA political consultant randomly surveys 500 voters in a district to see how many intend to vote for a certain candidate. Of the 500 voters surveyed, 265 indicate they will vote for the candidate. Use a 99% confidence interval, should the consultant predict that the candidate will win the election? Why or why not? (He/she must obtain a simple majority of the votes.)\n\nVerify the conditions for the CLT.\nConstruct a 99% confidence interval.\nSummarize your results.\n\n\n\na. The sample is random and independent. Since \\(n\\hat{p} = 500 \\times 0.53 = 265 \\geqslant 10\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{p}) = 500 \\times (1-0.53) = 235 \\geqslant 10\\), the sample size is sufficiently large. The population is sufficiently large since the population of voters in the district is much larger than 10 times the sample size. b. To construct a 99% confidence interval, we use \\(z^\\ast = 2.576\\). The standard error is estimated as \\[\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{est}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.53(1-0.53)}{500}} \\approx 0.0223.\n\\] The margin of error is \\[\nm = z^\\ast \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{est}} = 2.576 \\times 0.0223 \\approx 0.0574.\n\\] The lower bound of the confidence interval is \\[\n\\hat{p} - m = 0.53 - 0.0574 \\approx 0.4726.\n\\] The upper bound of the confidence interval is \\[\n\\hat{p} + m = 0.53 + 0.0574  \\approx 0.5874.\n\\] Thus, the 99% confidence interval is \\[\n(0.4726, \\; 0.5874).\n\\] c. The consultant should only predict a win if the confidence interval only contains values that are greater than 50%. Since the confidence interval includes values less than 0.5, it is not certain that the candidate will win the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 4.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nAccording to housingwire.com, 93.8% of homeowners had “positive equity” in their homes. Suppose that the margin of sampling error is \\(\\pm 3\\) percentage points with a confidence level of 95%.\n\nState the confidence interval in interval notation.\nHow would you interpret this confidence interval?\n\n\n\na. Note that \\(p = 0.938\\) and the margin of error is \\(m = 0.03\\). Thus, the confidence interval is \\[\n(0.938 - 0.03, 0.938 + 0.03) = (0.908, \\; 0.968).\n\\] b. We are 95% confident that the true proportion of all homeowners who have positive equity in their homes is between 90.8% and 96.8%."
