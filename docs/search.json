This was based on a survey of 2002 American adults.\n\nWhat is the population?\nWhat is the sample?\nWhat was the parameter of interest?\nWhat is the statistic?\n\n\n\na. The population is all American adults. b. The sample consists of the 2002 American adults surveyed. c. The parameter is proportion of all American adults who believed that GMOs were safe to consume. d. The statistic is 0.37.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 2.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA high school wants to measure how often students vape, so the administration asks teachers to survey students via a hand-raise asking them if they vape. Why might this produce a measurement bias?\n\n\nStudents may not want to admit to vaping in front of their teachers and peers. This would lead to inaccurate count of the students who vape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 3.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nInternet polls are very common with local news organizations. Why might internet polls produce a sampling bias?\n\n\nInternet polls may produce a sampling bias because they only include individuals who have internet access and are willing to participate in online surveys. This may exclude certain demographics, leading to a non-representative sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 4.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nIdentify possible biases from each of the following situations\n\nA survey of college students’ music preferences asks “Do you like rock music or another genre?”\nSuppose the county commissioners want to know if the county residents support constructing a new high-rise on the beach. They send out a survey to only beach residents.\n\n\n\na. The question is leading because it suggests that rock music is the preferred choice. b. The sample is biased because it only includes beach residents, who may have different opinions than non-beach residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 5.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nSuppose you want to estimate the mean GPA of all students at your school. You set up a table in the library asking for volunteers to tell you their GPAs. Do you think you would get a representative sample? Why or why not?\n\n\nNo. Students who volunteer to report their GPA may be more likely to have higher GPAs, leading to a sampling bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 6.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nAn August 2022 article from Forbes magazine read:\n“Results are in from the Florida’s first mandated system-wide survey of”intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity” at its public universities, and one indisputable conclusion can be drawn from it: most students, staff, and faculty ignored it, yielding little in the way of trustworthy results. The survey was required when Florida’s Republican-controlled Legislature at the urging of Governor Ron DeSantis, enacted House Bill 233, creating section 1001.73(13), in Florida Statutes, entitled INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AND VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT…Of the 368,000 college students who received the voluntary survey, 8,835, a measly 2.4%, completed it, according to the report presented Friday to the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System of Florida.”\nThe survey included questions such as: “How should colleges or universities handle students who disrupt invited speakers and prevent them from speaking?”” followed by a list of punitive measures. What biases, if any, do you find from this survey?\n\n\nThe low response rate (2.4%) indicates a likely sampling bias, as those who chose to respond may have different views than the overall population of students, staff, and faculty. Additionally, the wording of the question about disruptive students may introduce measurement bias, as it frames the issue in a way that could influence respondents’ answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 7.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA phone survey asked whether Social Security should be continued or abandoned immediately. Only landlines (not cell phones) were called. Do you think this would introduce bias? Explain.\n\n\nYes. This would likely introduce sampling bias because individuals who only use cell phones (often younger demographics) are excluded from the survey, potentially skewing the results towards the opinions of older individuals who are more likely to have landlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample 8.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nA school district is interested in finding out what percentage of voters in the district would favor the passage of a school bond measure. The district sends out a survey to all school parents asking, “Do you favor the passing of a school bond measure to provide additional resources to improve educational opportunities for your students?” Identify any sources of possible bias in this survey.\n\n\nThe question is leading, as it suggests that passing the bond measure will improve educational opportunities, which may influence respondents to answer favorably. Additionally, only parents of students in the school district are surveyed, which may not represent the views of all voters in the district."

    "text": "Section 7.2: Measure the Quality of a Survey\n\nStatistical Inference\nOne of the most import application of statistics is statistical inference, which is the process of using data from a sample to make estimates or test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population. However, since we are using a sample to make inferences about a population, there is always some uncertainty involved. Fortunately, we can quantify this uncertainty by measuring the quality of our estimates. Two important aspects of the quality of an estimate are its accuracy and precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAccuracy vs. Precision\n\n\n\n\nAccurate: The measurement process captures the intended quantity; it correctly estimates the population parameter.\nPrecise: If the measurement process is repeated, the estimates are very consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 1. Sample Proportion Distribution.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nLog into the computer station in front of you.\nScan the first QR code in the margin to take a quick survey.\nOpen a browser on your computer station and go to https://ckaoxvii.github.io/sample_proportion_distribution/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSampling Distribution\n\n\n\nRecall: Samples may be used to make inferences about a population. Taking repeated samples form a population create a distribution of sample statistics, called the sampling distribution.\n\nThe estimator \\(\\hat{p}\\) (sample proportion) is an unbiased estimator, as long as the samples are random.\nThe precision improves as sample size increases.\nThe shape of the sampling distribution is more symmetric as sample size increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCalculating Bias and Standard Error\n\n\n\nSuppose that\n\nthe samples are randomly chosen from the population, and\nif the sampling is without replacement, the population is at least 10 times larger than the sample size.\n\nThen\n\nthe bias of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is 0, and\nthe standard error (SE) of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is given by \\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}},\n\\] where \\(p\\) is the population proportion and \\(n\\) is the sample size."
